# LAMMPS Infrastructure Project Memories

## Requirements Gathered

### Simulation Requirements
- Type: Polymer materials science research in nanochemistry
- Size: 50K to 200K atoms
- Duration: 10-100 nanoseconds
- Runtime: 
  * 50K atoms: ~2 days per simulation
  * 200K atoms: ~7 days per simulation

### Infrastructure Requirements
- Single A100 GPU (scaled back from initial 8x A100)
- 100 hours per week usage
- Primarily non-business hours (nightly batch)
- 10TB storage requirement
- Results stored in S3 for sharing
- SSH access needed
- Checkpointing every 10 minutes
- Keep last 3 checkpoints

### Cost Optimization Requirements
- Use spot instances where possible
- AWS Batch for job management
- Region flexibility for best pricing (selected US-East-2)

## Key Decisions

### Infrastructure Choices
1. Compute:
   - AWS Batch with p4d.24xlarge spot instances
   - Single A100 GPU utilization
   - Spot instance interruption handling
   - Automatic failover to on-demand if needed

2. Storage:
   - S3 for long-term storage (10TB)
   - EBS gp3 volume for temporary storage
   - Checkpoint retention policy (last 3 only)

3. Container:
   - Base: nvidia/cuda:12.0.1-devel-ubuntu22.04
   - LAMMPS version: stable_23Jun2022
   - All accelerator packages enabled
   - ECR for container registry

4. Networking:
   - VPC with public/private subnets
   - SSH access via bastion host
   - S3 Gateway Endpoint

### Implementation Strategy
1. Container Configuration:
   - GPU optimization for A100
   - CUDA-aware MPI
   - Checkpoint integration
   - Spot termination handling

2. Job Management:
   - AWS Batch for scheduling
   - Spot instance primary with on-demand fallback
   - Automated checkpoint management

3. Cost Management:
   - Spot instances for 60-90% savings
   - Region selection for optimal pricing
   - Storage tiering for cost efficiency
