## Pending Implementation

### Phase 1: Initial Setup
❌ Container build and testing
❌ ECR repository creation
❌ Container push to ECR
❌ VPC and networking setup
❌ S3 bucket creation
❌ AWS Batch configuration

### Phase 2: Testing
❌ Container GPU performance testing
❌ AWS Batch job submission testing
❌ Checkpoint system validation
❌ Spot interruption recovery testing
❌ End-to-end simulation testing

### Phase 3: Production Setup
❌ IAM roles and policies implementation
❌ Security group configuration
❌ CloudWatch monitoring setup
❌ Cost monitoring and alerts
❌ SSH access configuration

### Phase 4: Documentation Updates
❌ User guides based on actual deployment
❌ Troubleshooting guide based on testing
❌ Performance tuning recommendations
❌ Production deployment checklist

## Next Steps

1. Immediate Actions Needed:
   - Build and test container locally
   - Validate GPU acceleration
   - Test checkpoint system
   - Deploy AWS infrastructure

2. Validation Requirements:
   - Verify 50K atom simulation performance
   - Confirm checkpoint overhead < 2 minutes
   - Test spot interruption recovery
   - Validate data persistence

3. Production Preparation:
   - Complete security implementation
   - Set up monitoring
   - Configure alerting
   - Document operational procedures

## Notes

- Current Status: Infrastructure code and documentation complete, pending actual deployment and testing
- Critical Path: Container build and testing must be completed before AWS infrastructure deployment
- Risk Areas: GPU performance optimization, spot interruption handling, checkpoint system efficiency
- Timeline Impact: Implementation can proceed according to the original 3-week plan

## Required Resources

1. For Testing:
   - Local development environment with GPU
   - AWS account with appropriate permissions
   - Test simulation configurations

2. For Deployment:
   - AWS credentials
   - ECR repository
   - S3 bucket allocation
   - Network configuration details

## Validation Criteria

To consider each phase complete:

### Phase 1
- Container successfully builds
- GPU acceleration verified
- AWS resources properly configured
- Basic job submission works

### Phase 2
- Performance meets requirements
- Checkpoints working reliably
- Spot interruption handled gracefully
- Data properly persisted to S3

### Phase 3
- Security controls verified
- Monitoring functional
- Cost tracking accurate
- SSH access working

### Phase 4
- Documentation reflects actual setup
- Users can successfully submit jobs
- Support procedures documented
- Maintenance tasks defined
